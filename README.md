# Baseball Statistics Processor

A Python tool for processing baseball team statistics from Excel files to consolidated CSV output.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install pandas numpy openpyxl
   ```

## Processing Data

- Place Excel files in the `input` directory, organized by round:
  ```
  input/
    ROUND-1/
      1TEAMNAME.xlsx
      2TEAMNAME.xlsx
      ...
    ROUND-2/
      ...
  ```
- Run the processing script:
  ```
  python3 process.py
  ```
- Output CSVs will be generated in a timestamped `output/` directory.

## Local Development

To preview the website locally (including the latest CSVs):

```
npx http-server output
```

## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project uses GitHub Actions to process the latest Excel files and publish the resulting CSVs and web app to GitHub Pages. The output CSV files (`Batting.csv`, `Pitching.csv`, `Fielding.csv`) are **not committed to the repository**; they are generated during the GitHub Actions workflow and published directly to GitHub Pages.

To deploy:

1. Push your changes to the repository.
2. Go to the Actions tab on GitHub and manually trigger the `pages-deploy` workflow ("Run workflow").
3. The workflow will:
   - Run the Python processing script to generate the latest CSVs in `output/`.
   - Publish `index.html`, `main.js`, and the three main CSVs (`Batting.csv`, `Pitching.csv`, `Fielding.csv`) to GitHub Pages.

The site will be available at the repository's GitHub Pages URL after the workflow completes.

## Folder Structure

- `output/` â€” Contains all static assets and generated CSVs
  - `index.html`, `main.js`, `style.css`: Static site assets
  - `*.csv`: Generated by `process.py`, ignored by git

## Overview

This project takes baseball statistics stored in Excel files (organized by team and round) and processes them into consolidated CSV files for batting, pitching, and fielding statistics.
